"""
Intent

    Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern.
    Let pass requests along a chain of handlers.
    Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it
    to the next handler in the chain.

Pros and Cons

    You can control the order of request handling.
    Single Responsibility Principle. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes
    that perform operations.
    Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing
    client code.

    Some requests may end up unhandled.
