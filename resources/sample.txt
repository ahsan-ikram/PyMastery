Intense Tropical Cyclone Batsirai was a deadly tropical cyclone which heavily impacted
Madagascar in February 2022, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Madagascar
since Cyclone Enawo in 2017.

It made landfall two weeks after Tropical Storm Ana brought deadly floods to the island country
in late January. The second tropical disturbance, the first tropical cyclone, and the first intense
tropical cyclone of the 2021–22 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Batsirai originated from a
tropical disturbance that was first noted on 24 January 2022.

It fluctuated in intensity and became a moderate tropical storm on 27 January 2022, after which it
unexpectedly rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone.
It then weakened and struggled to intensify through the coming days due to present wind shear and dry
air, where it weakened after some time. Afterward, it entered much more favorable conditions, rapidly
intensified yet again to a high-end Category 4 cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale while moving towards
Madagascar.

The storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle the next day, and fluctuated in intensity before making
landfall in Madagascar as a Category 3 cyclone, later rapidly weakening due to the mountainous terrain on
the island.
